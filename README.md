The construction industry is one of the main economic sectors in Israel and is expected to maintain its central position in the coming decades in light of the country's rapid population growth rate. Different from many developed countries, where the rate of new construction is slow due to low rates of population growth, in Israel the built-up area doubles every 25 years. The creation of a textual corpus in Hebrew on construction, planning, and architecture is expected to facilitate and expedite the development of NLP-based tools for application and assimilation in technological fields related to the construction industry.

The corpus consists of Hebrew documents from a wide variety of contemporary and historical sources, including legislative decrees, regulatory guidelines, research reports, academic studies, and professional journals. In the development of the corpus, we are using digitally born as well as scanned printed publications, which go through a process of optical character recognition (OCR), cleaning, and parsing.

This work was supported by the Israel Innovation Authority. The corpus is available for all types of uses for NLP research and development according to the CC BY 4.0 license (Attribution 4.0 International).

This is a work in progress. More documents are continuously processed and uploaded to this repository.
